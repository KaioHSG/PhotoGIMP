## How to install?

**1**. Install [**GIMP**](https://www.gimp.org/downloads) (2.10).

**2**. Download a version of [**PhotoGIMP Windows**](https://github.com/kaiohsg/photogimp-windows/releases/latest) (`PhotoGIMP-Windows.exe.zip` is best).

**3**. Run `Install PhotoGIMP Windows.exe` and confirm the replacement of the previous configuration. If you downloaded `Install PhotoGIMP Windows.bat` you will need the
[**PhotoGIMP**](https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP/releases/latest) (just leave the `.zip` file with the installer).

This is a fork of [PhotoGIMP](https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP) by [Diolinux](https://github.com/Diolinux). I just made a simple installer for Windows.
